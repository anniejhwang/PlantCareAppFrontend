## General features

The Plant Care App offers the following features:

- User Signup and Login: An authentication feature to create a personalized account for the user.
- Plant library: a database of plants with information on the specific plant, care requirements such as sunlight and frequency of watering, and photos.
- Plant tracker: Users can save a plant and track their watering care routines.

## Technologies

This Plant Care App is created with:

- Ruby on Rails: A server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License.
- React.js: An open-source Javascript Framework and library for building web applications.
- Plant API: A third-party API for accessing plant care information. The API site I used was [Perenual](https://perenual.com/docs/api).
- Bootstrap: A free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.

## Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/anniejhwang/PlantCareApp.git
2. install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

Hurray! We just set up the frontend of our Plant Care App! If you haven't already, you can set up the backend, by following this link: [PlantCareApp (backend)](https://github.com/anniejhwang/PlantCareApp).

You'll need to have the backend code running on http://localhost:3000.
You can view the app on http://localhost:5173.

## Roadmap

- Plant library: Enhancing the plantlibrary to incorporate specific growing tips, more photos, and common plant diseases or illnesses.
- Plant tracker: Enhancing the plant tracker so that it can also track fertilizing and or pruning.
- Reminders: Allowing users to set reminders for watering, fertilizing, repotting, and or other care tasks to ensure their plants stay healthy.
- Community: Allowing users to connect with other plant parents where they can share tips, photos, or advice.
- Third Party API: Currently the API I used will only allow one plant to be searched at a time as well as only making 300 API requests a day. I would want to find a way to allow the users to make as many requests as they can to ensure the best user experience.
